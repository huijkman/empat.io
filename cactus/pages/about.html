      <h2>About Empat.io</h2>
      <p>Accessibility is about people and Empat.io needs much more of them. I'm looking for people who want to tell their story so I can show it here. And I want to know what you think. All thoughts and suggestions are welcome. Please let me know at: johan@q42.nl or @huijkman</p>
